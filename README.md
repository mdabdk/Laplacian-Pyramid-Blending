# Laplacian Pyramid Blending

This project demonstrates the use of Gaussian pyramids and Laplacians (gradients) to perform image blending. `main.py` should be run first. The user will then be asked to choose regions of two images to blend together. Note that only basic NumPy functions were used in this project to enforce better understanding of the algorithm.
